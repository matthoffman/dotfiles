Intro
=====

This repo has gone through a lot of incarnations over the years, but at the moment it's 
just a random assortment of config files I tend to use on any workstation. My zsh config
is in [zprezto](https://github.com/matthoffman/oh-my-zsh), and I've been using Spacemacs
for emacs config on and off for a while. 

This is the assorted extra bits.
