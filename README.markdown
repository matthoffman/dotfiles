Intro
=====

This repo has gone through a lot of incarnations over the years, but at the moment it's 
just a random assortment of config files I tend to use on any workstation. My zsh config
is in [its own repo](https://github.com/matthoffman/zdotdir), and I've been using 
Spacemacs or similar kitchen-sink emacs configs on and off for a while. 

This is the assorted extra bits.
